# Introduction

Welcome to datui documentation!

datui is a terminal user interface (TUI) for exploring and analyzing tabular data files. Built with Rust, Polars, and Ratatui, it provides an interactive environment for data exploration, querying, statistical analysis, and visualization within the terminal.

![Basic Navigation Demo](../demos/01-basic-navigation.gif)

Watch as datui loads and displays tabular data with smooth navigation. Use vim-style keys (`j`/`k` for up/down, `h`/`l` for left/right) to explore your data interactively.

For more demonstrations of datui's features, see the [Demos](demos.md) page.

## Key Features

- **Memory-efficient**: Uses lazy evaluation with Polars
- **Interactive**: Full-featured TUI with keyboard navigation
- **Powerful**: Query, filter, sort, and analyze data
- **Fast**: Built with Rust for performance

## Philosophy

Datui follows a philosophy of memory-efficient data exploration using lazy evaluation, providing quick insights into datasets without requiring external tools or heavy infrastructure.
