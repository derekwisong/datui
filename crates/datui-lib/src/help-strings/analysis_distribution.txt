Distribution Analysis identifies the distribution type for each numeric column and provides key statistical measures.

Columns:
  Column:        Name of the numeric column
  Distribution:  Inferred distribution type (Normal, LogNormal, Uniform, PowerLaw, Exponential)
  Shapiro-Wilk:  W statistic from Shapiro-Wilk normality test (0-1, higher = more normal)
  SW p-value:    P-value from Shapiro-Wilk test (probability of observing W under normality)
  CV:            Coefficient of variation (std/mean, relative variability independent of scale)
  Outliers:      Count and percentage of outliers (IQR method)
  Skewness:      Asymmetry measure (positive = right-tailed, negative = left-tailed)
  Kurtosis:      Tail heaviness compared to normal distribution (3.0 = normal)

Color Coding:
  Distribution types are color-coded:
    - Green/Cyan: Good fit quality (>0.75)
    - Yellow:     Moderate fit quality (≤0.75)
    - Red:        Very high outlier percentage (>20%) or extreme skewness/kurtosis
