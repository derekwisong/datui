# Introduction

Datui is an interactive terminal user interface (TUI) for exploring and analyzing data files.

> Datui is in rapid development—features and interfaces are evolving as built. Expect some changes between releases en route to a stable foundation.

## See It In Action

Use arrow keys or vim-style bindings (`j`/`k` for up/down, `h`/`l` for left/right) to explore interactively.
